# ChristmasLights.Controller
The quick and dirty python program that runs the lights. 

This was my first attempt at doing anything with Python beyond basic scripting. 
Python was required becuase I wanted to use the neopixel library to control the lights rather than having to write my own c# library to handle this since this was time constrained. 

This project takes a binary file that is generated by [ChristmasLights.ExcelToLightFile](https://github.com/bmol118/ChristmasLights.ExcelToLightFile) and reads the bytes from it to generate a series of frames which contain all the rgb values for each light along with a double that determines how long that frame is displayed for. 
I also added a time contoller to this so I could just start the program once and then it would turn on for a set interval and then off automatically.

## TODOS
* This project was meant to be a temporary solution, I am planning on replacing it with a c# library to control the led strip and this will allow me to remove the intermediate step of generating a binary file that contains the light values.
